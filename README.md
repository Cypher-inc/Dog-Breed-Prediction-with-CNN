# 🐶 Dog Breed Prediction Using CNN

This project builds a deep learning model that predicts the breed of a dog from an image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Leveraging a dataset of 70 dog breeds, the model is trained with data augmentation, early stopping, and evaluated with performance metrics and prediction results.
